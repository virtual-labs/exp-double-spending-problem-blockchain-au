<h4>Centralized Database Double-Spending</h4>

<ol>

<li>
<p>Please refer to the right-hand section of the interface to start the simulation </p></li>

<li><p>Within the "Double Spending" sidebar, you will find two options: "Centralized" and "Blockchain."</p></li>

<li><p>By default, the "Centralized" option is active. Below the "Centralized" option, you will find a section or text box that provides the definition of double spending within a centralized database.
Read the definition to understand how double spending occurs in a centralized system.

</li>

<li>
<p>
Click on the "Amount" input field to specify the exact amount you wish to send in the transaction.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>

Below the animation, users can view a step-by-step breakdown of how the bank processes a demand draft. Within the instruction panel, users can access a "Cancel Request" button, allowing them to observe in real-time how double spending unfolds in the context of a bank's demand draft process, providing insights into potential vulnerabilities in centralized systems.
