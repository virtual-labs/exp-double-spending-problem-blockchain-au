<u><h3> Procedure</h3></u>

<p>In this interactive transaction app, users can experience firsthand the difference between procedural centralized and blockchain systems when it comes to double spending. The app allows users to initiate a transaction by selecting a recipient and specifying the amount to be sent. As the transaction progresses, a visually engaging three-dimensional animation dynamically illustrates the distinct processes involved in each system. Users can observe how the procedural centralized system is susceptible to double spending as transactions are processed through a single authority, while the blockchain technology effectively prevents double spending by ensuring transparency, immutability, and consensus among network participants. This educational tool offers a unique and immersive learning experience for understanding the security advantages of blockchain technology over traditional centralized approaches.</p>

<h3>Centralized Database Double-Spending</h3>

<ol>

<li>
<p>Look for the sidebar labeled "Double Spending" on the right side of the app interface </p></li>

<li><p>Within the "Double Spending" sidebar, you will find two options: "Centralized" and "Blockchain."</p></li>

<li><p>By default, the "Centralized" option is active. Below the "Centralized" option, you will find a section or text box that provides the definition of double spending within a centralized database.
