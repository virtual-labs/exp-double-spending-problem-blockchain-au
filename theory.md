<b><p>Double Spending</p></b>

<p>
Double spending is a fraudulent activity in which a person attempts to spend the same digital currency or asset more than once, exploiting vulnerabilities in the system. 
It poses a significant risk in digital payment systems. 
Preventing double spending involves verifying transactions, ensuring atomicity, maintaining logs and audits, and using unique transaction identifiers. 
While centralized databases rely on trust in a single authority to prevent double spending, blockchain uses decentralized consensus mechanisms to secure transactions and prevent fraud.

<b><p>Double Spending in Centralized Databases</p></b>

<p>
In a centralized database system, double spending can occur if a user exploits vulnerabilities to spend the same funds more than once. 
For example, in the case of demand drafts, a malicious user may attempt to present the same draft to two different entities for payment. 
Since the system depends on a single authority, if proper concurrency control or validation checks fail, double spending may succeed.

<b><p>Double Spending in Blockchain</p></b>

<p>
In blockchain, every transaction is recorded in a block and added to a chronological chain. 
When a user initiates a cryptocurrency transaction, the network validates it through consensus mechanisms such as <b>Proof of Work</b>. 
An attacker may attempt to broadcast conflicting transactions (e.g., sending the same coin to two recipients), but these attempts fail because the blockchain follows the <b>longest chain rule</b>. 
The chain with the most accumulated Proof of Work is accepted as valid, making it computationally impractical for attackers to reverse or alter confirmed transactions unless they control the majority of the networkâ€™s mining power (51% attack). 
Thus, blockchain effectively prevents double spending by ensuring transparency, immutability, and decentralized consensus.
